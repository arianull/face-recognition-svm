# Face Recognition with SVM on Olivetti Faces Dataset

This repository contains the code for a face recognition project using SVM on the Olivetti Faces Dataset. The aim of this project is to train a classifier that can recognize faces from the dataset with a high level of accuracy.\
SVM in this project is implemented from scratch.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

* scikit-learn
* numpy
* matplotlib

# Dataset
The Olivetti Faces Dataset is a set of face images that were collected in 1992 by AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. The dataset contains 400 images of 40 individuals, with 10 images per individual. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 64x64 pixels.

The dataset is included in the scikit-learn library, so you don't need to download it separately.
